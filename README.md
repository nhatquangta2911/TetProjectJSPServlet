# TetProjectJSPServlet

<br>This is a small project which I have been doing to practice JSP and Servlet. So that I can move on the next step is continue making the completed web application in the next few months.
Because next week is Tet holiday, so I have to work harder than usual, and the important thing now is reading <b> Head First Servlet & JSP </b> book. Since all about in English, I can even get more motivations to complete all the tasks.

<hr><b><i>SPECIAL NOTE: </i></b>In this project, I don't use Database to save and get data. Rely on the requirement of the exercise, I'm supposed to get data by reading Files.
